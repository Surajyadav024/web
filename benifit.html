        Although experts are still learning a lot about the COVID-19 vaccines,
        there are some clear benefits to getting vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p class="rrr">
        If you’ve already received the vaccine, great job! Share these facts
        with others who might be hesitant. If you’re unsure whether the vaccine
        is right for you, consider these four benefits the vaccine could provide
        you and your loved ones.

        The vaccine reduces your risk of infection.
      </h2>
      <p class="rrr" style="margin-top: -3%">
        Once you receive your first shot, your body begins producing antibodies
        to the coronavirus. These antibodies help your immune system fight the
        virus if you happen to be exposed, so it reduces your chance of getting
        the disease. There are three vaccines available for use in the United
        States, and they are all effective in preventing infection.
      </p>
      <p class="rrr" style="margin-top: 6%">
        It’s true that you can still become infected after being vaccinated, but
        once more of the population is vaccinated, those chances are further
        reduced thanks to something called. So getting vaccinated not only
        reduces your chance of being infected, it also contributes to community
        protection, reducing the likelihood of virus transmission.
      </p>
      <h2 class="lead" style="margin-top: 5%">
        The vaccine can help your unborn baby or newborn.
      </h2>
      <p class="rrr">
        Studies have found that expectant mothers who receive the COVID-19
        vaccine create antibodies to the virus and pass those to their unborn
        baby through the placenta. Mothers were also shown to pass antibodies to
        their newborns through breast milk. This suggests those newborns have
        some immunity to the virus, which is especially important as young
        children cannot get the vaccine. Learn more about
      </p>
      <h2 class="rrr" style="margin-top: 6%; font-size: 190%">
        The vaccine protects against severe illness.
      </h2>
      <p class="rrr" style="margin-top: 1px">
        During studies, the three vaccines — Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and
        Pfizer — have shown to be effective at preventing severe illness from
        COVID-19. So if you are vaccinated and become infected, you are very
        unlikely to become severely ill.
      </p>
      <p class="rrr">
        The CDC tracks confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations by vaccination
        status. For adults 18 and older, unvaccinated people were eight times
        more likely to be hospitalized than fully vaccinated people. Among
        adolescents between ages 12-17, unvaccinated people are 10 times more
        likely to be hospitalized than fully vaccinated people.
